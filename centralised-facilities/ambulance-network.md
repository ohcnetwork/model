# Ambulance Network

The advantage of a an ambulance network is that the driver will be separated from people in back. Each hospital has plenty of ambulances but there has to real-time knowledge of where each ambulance is and whether it is free.  
  
An efficient routing algorithm will transport people from a CCC to the nearby Hospital which has a capacity to absorb a patient who gets really sick.  
  
There has to be a Centralised Patient Medical Record which will inform the Hospital in advance of the basic details of the patient.
