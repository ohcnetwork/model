  The first step each institution should do is to model the capacity that each
  individual institution can create and contribute to the CCC Network.

# Capacity Modelling

## Rules of Thumb

* [ ] Enter the total number of students in the institution
* [ ] Enter the total number of buildings
* [ ] Enter the total number of classrooms
* [ ] Enter the total number of large halls \(like exam halls\)
* [ ] Calculate the capacity

```
$ The rule of thumb is that each person needs 8Ft*4Ft area to sit and lie down.
```

 The system will give a capacity that can be then created at that center. Loyola has 36 classrooms where 1000 students study and 3 large exam halls.  
  
The School can then split the capacity into two parts.  
  
1. Inpatient comes in  
2. 

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
