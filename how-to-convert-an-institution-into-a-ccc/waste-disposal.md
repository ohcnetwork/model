# Waste Disposal

## **Medical Waste Disposal**

We need to connect to the IMA \(Indian Medical Association Waste Management System\) called IMAGE.  
  
We need to follow the process given by IMA and then IMA will collect the waste from the CCC daily.

## General Waste

Food waste and non food waste has to be separated and collected.
